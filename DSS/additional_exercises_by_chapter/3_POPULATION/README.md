* Estimating the Bias in Self-Reported Turnout - Part II: Computing and Interpreting Means
   * Research Question: Is There Bias in Self-Reported Turnout?
   * Skills Practice: Use arithmetic operators to create new variables from existing ones, plus compute and interpret means.
   * Code Used: read.csv(), <-, head(), \, *, $ (to access and to create a variable within a dataframe), mean()
   * Difficulty: Intermediate (if assigned as part of Chapter 1), Easy (if assigned as part of Chapter 3)
   
* Estimating the Bias in Self-Reported Turnout - Part III: Subsetting Variables and Creating Histograms
   * Research Question: Is There Bias in Self-Reported Turnout?
   * Skills Practiced: Create new variables, visualize the distribution of a variable, subset variables, and compute and interpret means.
   * Code Used: read.csv(), <-, head(), \, *, $ (to access and to create a variable within a dataframe), hist(), [], mean()
   * Difficulty: Intermediate   

* Evidence of Data Fabrication
   * Research Question: Do We Find Evidence of Data Fabrication?
   * Skills Practiced: Create histograms, compute descriptive statistics, create scatter plots, compute correlation coefficients, and use optional arguments in R functions.
   * Based on:  David Broockman, Joshua Kalla, and Peter Aronow. "Irregularities in LaCour (2014)"
   * Code Used: read.csv(), <-, head(), dim(), $, hist(), mean(), median(), sd(), plot(), cor()
   * Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced
   
* Effects of Female Leaders in India - Part IV: Visualizations and Correlations
   * Research Question: Do Women Promote Different Policies than Men?
   * Skills Practiced: Create and make sense of visualizations and compute and interpret the correlation between two variables, among other things.
   * Code Used: read.csv(), <-, head(), hist(), $, plot(), cor()
   * Based on: Raghabendra Chattopadhyay and Esther Duflo. 2004. "Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India." Econometrica, 72 (5): 1409â€“43.
   * Difficulty: Easy
   
* Effect of Assassination of Leaders on Level of Democracy - Part I: Visualizations and Correlations
   * Research Question: What is the Effect of the Death of the Leader on the Level of Democracy?
   * Skills Practiced: Computing the number of observations in a dataset, create table of frequencies, compute and interpret means, create density histograms, subset variables, create scatter plots, and compute correlation coefficients.
   * Code Used: read.csv(), <-, head(), dim(), table(), $, mean(), hist(), [], ==, plot(), cor()
   * Based on: Benjamin F. Jones and Benjamin A. Olken. 2009. "Hit or Miss? The Effect of Assassinations on Institutions and War." American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 1 (2): 55-87.
