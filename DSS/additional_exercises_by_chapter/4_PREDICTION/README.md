IMPORTANT: Feel free to draw on these materials when using the book as the main textbook in your course, but please do not share the additional real-world datasets provided or the solutions to these exercises with anyone outside your class. For example, please do not post them on a non-gated website or in a public GitHub repository.
****************************************************************************************************

* Predicting Course Grades - Part I: Predicting Final Exam Scores
   * Goal: Predict Final Exam Scores Using Midterm Scores (Note: The outcome is non-binary)
   * Skills Practiced: Fit a line to make predictions when Y is non-binary, including computing correlations, creating scatter plots, adding the fitted line to the plot, and computing R-squared.
   * Code Used: read.csv(), <-, head(), cor(), $, lm(), plot(), abline(), ^
   * Difficulty: Easy
   * Note: We recommend using real, historical performance data from your own class.

* Predicting Course Grades - Part II: Predicting Overall Scores
   * Goal: Predict Overall Scores in the Course Using Midterm Scores (Note: The outcome is non-binary)
   * Skills Practiced: Fit a line to make predictions when Y is non-binary, including computing correlations, creating scatter plots, adding the fitted line to the plot, and computing R-squared.
   * Code Used: read.csv(), <-, head(), cor(), $, lm(), plot(), abline(), ^
   * Difficulty: Easy, especially if assigned after Part I
   * Note: We recommend using real, historical performance data from your own class.

* Predicting Course Grades - Part III: Predicting Probability of Earning an A or A-
   * Goal: Predict Probability of Earning an A or A- in the Course Using Midterm Scores (Note: The outcome is binary)
   * Skills Practiced: Fit a line to make predictions when Y is binary, including computing correlations, creating scatter plots, adding the fitted line to the plot, and computing R-squared.
   * Code Used: read.csv(), <-, head(), cor(), $, lm(), plot(), abline(), ^
   * Difficulty: Easy, especially if assigned after Parts I and II
   * Note: We recommend using real, historical performance data from your own class.

* Predicting Elections Using Betting Markets
   * Goal: Predict State-Level Electoral Outcomes Based on Closing Price of Contracts in Betting Markets (Note: The outcome is non-binary)
   * Skills Practiced: Create new variables, create histograms, compute correlations, create scatter plots, fit a linear model for predictive purposes, make predictions using the fitted line, compute and interpret R-squared.
   * Code Used: read.csv(), <-, head(), dim(), $, hist(), cor(), lm(), plot(), abline(), ^
   * Difficulty: Intermediate
